	 NonnumericalMetadata(longest=Update as on 28.10.2018:*********************************The power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visible,the insulation pvc of the cores doesn't look very durable.I don't know why such standard manufacturers can't provide a decent durable cable?The iron however is performing flawlessly.Still disappointed ,as in coming weeks i'll have to change the cable for sure.Reducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand name.HOW IT STARTED - THE NEED FOR AN IRON:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRecently , my previous Bajaj make dry iron, which I received as a gift from somewhere, started giving problems after two years of occasional use & with “not so careful handling and care”. Initially, Its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which I repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems. Finally, its ON indication went OFF and I decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new one.Hence, my search for a reputed brand make , best value for money device began .Being from Electrical Engineering background & occupation, I fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below:1.) DRY IRON VS STEAM IRON :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but vice-versa was not possible. Also, almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purpose.On the contrary, As the steam  loosens the individual fibres of the clothes, the steam iron's pressing action smooths out wrinklesHence it was better to be  equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself.2.) BRAND REPUTATION & WARRANTY:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAs an average consumer, We are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better. Rightfully so ,A brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience & research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted upon.Following the same footprints I thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the Super brands like Philips having decades of expertise in this field..Our product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion .3.) STEAM OUTPUT , STEAM BURST & VERTICAL STEAM FEATURE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxDuring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above 8 grams/min is okay but Some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam. In such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy. Users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed. More holes in the sole plate add  to the effectiveness of steam  supplied.Vertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam  in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing force.However in practical scenario and by virtue of  its design and water tank limitations , a steam iron is virtually incapable of  addressing the wrinkles like that and  hence paying more for such a feature is not advised.Use dedicated garment steamers for that purpose.** Our Philips GC1905 comes with a variable setting for steam  output with a continuous delivery of  up to 17 grams/min which is quite good.Additionally, It can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles. Vertical steam feature is not available though.4.) ELECTRICAL RELATED FEATURES: WATTAGE, CORD,THERMOSTAT etc.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks.1. Surely, more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above 1500 Watts , I would suggest to only plug-in to the power sockets.Going for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you  really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times.2. Surely, More heat developed  is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective ,Your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settings.Generating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system.3. Last but not the least - More power  doesn’t always mean  quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material & thickness of the sole plate , Surface area of  the heating element used  inside the soleplate etc.Most of  these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer.** OUR PRODUCT:# Comes with a decent 1440 Watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics.# Comes with a 250 Volts, 10 Amp ( Max. rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage) 3 pin Top which can  be easily plugged into our casual 6 amp sockets as well without any damage to the socket.Hence enhanced mobility & performance.# The cord length is around 1.8 meters which is good enough for any practical lengths,Any more than that would be cumbersome to handle.. The cord  is braided with an insulated  cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damage.However in due course of use, the cord often develops rigid twists & turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten out.So not so great on the cable quality terms.# The cable only comes with 180 degrees of swivel movement, which is quite disappointing and I would  have  really wished if it was 360 degrees of cord freedom.# The thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular 5 settings but going with a reputed brand like Philips always assures of a good quality of thermostat.After all, the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable.# Lastly our product is an ISI marked product  which is quite an assurance for sure.5.) SOLEPLATE MATERIAL & SHAPE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplates.A variety of soleplates are available in the market today like non-stick Teflon coated ,aluminium plates with American  heritage coating, Steel plates with alloys or Ceramic coated.Each has its pros and cons.# Teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time.# American Heritage is similar to Teflon and glides over the fabric even better.# Stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settings.Adds weight to the device. Metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers.# Good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution  but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stick.When  ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex, a ceramic iron will suit your needs best, as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling.# Aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes.** Our Product comes with a linished soleplate which  is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat.# However apart from linishing stuff, I can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding, Its heavy but doesn’t stick to the clothes yet.For that matter I trusted  the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate. Stay away from Teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off  fast.Regarding the shape , I honestly wanted  it to look like American fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colors..LOL..However ,those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this “Still-Decent Looking “model.6.) FEATURES LIKE ANTI DRIP ,ANTI-CALC, GRIP:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxTo tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose  for most of the users. Presence of these features, isn’t a problem  though , as in areas where the water comes hard, Anti-calc may stir and clear the calcium build up ,if any in the water tank.However ,If you use proper water, drain it out timely , Do not fully fill the tank , allow it to heat before using steam  & follow all procedures correctly, you won’t actually need to use these features.Regarding Grip ,Many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip.** Our product comes with the anti-calc function  and is decent to grip though I think not ergonomically, still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon.7.) PRICE VS PERFORMANCE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxEven though I did not have any preset price tag in my mind  but still going over 2500 would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that I don’t make use of that much.** I bought it at a price of around 1200 bucks & for  all the features and performance it delivers - I think it is worth it.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all , I would just say, that even though our product might not have the best  appealing looks or the best soleplate or  the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord , still, what it has is  – a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent right-performing way, which is hard to come by in an  individual model.,I got this one on-demand from mother. For a few days, she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores. I was already researching iron for one of my friends. So this search did not last long. :DEven earlier, Philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency & product quality. I also had Bajaj, Usha, Morphy in the list. But trust in Philips did not let me go for any other brand.I got this Iron well in one piece and without any scratches on the soleplate.•••••••••••••••INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••→Steam Iron inside a poly pack→Instruction leaflet/Warranty card•••••••••ABOUT•••••••••Wattage: 1440 wattWeight: ~1 kgWater Capacity: 180 mlCord length: 1.8 meterIndicator: on/off (based on temperature setting)Max Water level markingWarranty: 2 years•••••••PROS•••••••1. Good quality iron with effective ironing & steaming.2. Body is solid with good finish overall at this range.3. Linished- Teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics. Gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture.4. Sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage.5. Capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation (30 min or more in one fill).6. Spray function is well designed, it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water.7. The spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric, making it easier to iron out tough creases.8. Wattage (1440w) is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes.9. Easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole.10. Easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole, and the sideways opening door.11. Weight on the ok side, not a lightweight but not even heavyweight. Some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth. (Empty iron is lightweight only.)••••••••CONS••••••••1. Steam control knob looks loose at first, but it works well in the long run.2. Water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation. But that's the way it will work & you can't do anything.3. For regular lightweight iron users, it will appear bulky at first. But you get used to it in a few days.4. No steam burst function in this model GC1905 but you get what you pay for.▶ Cons are temporary and don't affect functionality in the long run. So a ★★★★★ device.•••••••••••••••••••••••••BUTTONS & KNOBS•••••••••••••••••••••••••Spray Button→ push to spraySteam Knob→ Off: no steam→ Low: less steam→ High: high steam→ Calc clean mode: calcium deposit cleaning (more below)Temperature Dial→ Rotate to set temperature cutoff for different fabric types (Linen, Cotton, Woolen, Silk, etc)••••••••••••••••••USAGE GUIDE••••••••••••••••••1. Keep knob & dial in off position.2. Fill the tank to the max level if planning to use steam function.3. Connect to mains.4. Set the temperature control knob to the required position.5. Let it warm up until the indicator goes off.6. Now operate steam knob to low or high steam.7. Enjoy ironing or steaming without interruption till water lasts.8. Use water spray function as required.•••••••••••••••USAGE TIPS•••••••••••••••1. Use RO filtered water if possible as it's low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices.2. let the iron heat properly before use. Leakage has been observed if one uses the Iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam.3. Gently clean soleplate and don't use any hard material or chemicals.4. Emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem. As calcium deposits are more in standing water.5. Untangle & straighten the cord once after every use before storage. As these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure.6. When not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position.7. Use calc clean mode once in 2 weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness. If water is very hard, increase the frequency or if using RO water decrease frequency.8. Once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar. To remove the needle, rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out.9. Last but most important, use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocks.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••CALC CLEANING MODE•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••This iron has a calc cleaning mode to descale it. To do so follow the steps below:1. Keep knob in the steam off position.2. Fill tank to max level.3. Rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off.4. Take out socket from mains and move iron to sink.5. Turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms.6. Let all water be used up.7. Steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits.▶ The principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone, which leads to contraction & expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush out.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••CLARIFICATION: DAMAGE TO BODY OR PLATE & OTHER ISSUES (concerns raised by other users)•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Several users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues. Let me put my insights into those.→ I had no issue with the quality of the product delivered. It arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere, as proper care was taken for this using air cushions. Maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit.→ Soleplate had no marks on it. Yes, here Philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints, for the damaged sole plate on arrival.→ Temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage.→ Slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones, as different materials are used as per requirement. Say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back.→ Leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water. So it's passed directly, & appears as leakage. Philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details.▶ Remember to order it from a reputed seller. Check seller ratings, reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues, like the faulty product, duplicate product, etc.••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••DON'T GET CONFUSED (There's No Steam Burst Mode Here)••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. Some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button & even some users have mentioned this in their reviews, but it is not present in this model. Models with the said function have two buttons (for spray & burst) instead of one here (for spray only).2. Also, steam output at one place is 13g/min, another place 17g/min. Its actually 17g/min.•••••••••••••••••••FINAL VERDICT•••••••••••••••••••▶ If you are looking for good quality, durable steaming iron in the 1.5k range, Philips is the name you should seek for. This model of Philips has got good build quality & features which are more than enough for an average home user. So at any point, you can go for this model.▶ If on a lower budget (<1k range) you can go for Philips GC1011 1200w or Bajaj MX 3 1250w but both are low power and Philips one misses steam spray function too. But still, both will cover most of the usage pattern of a home user.▶ Heavy users may go for Philips EasySpeed Plus GC2040 2100w or Black+Decker BD BXIR2001IN 2000w or Morphy Richards Super Glide 2000w in 2k range.••••••••NOTE••••••••→ Unlike regular lightweight irons, steam irons generally don't go easy with repairs.→ Unlike regular iron, If the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced & if you are out of warranty it will cost you a lot. In fact, for the cost of the plate plus a few bucks, you get a new iron.→ So, check your requirement for regular vs steam iron & choose wisely.,I tried removing hard wrinkles of a jeans but it couldn’t remove them properly. They were still visible even after using the steam.,Easyto use but it leaks water,Very good,Its a good product,Iron is good and the best delivery with few hours, just this iron doesn't have a stream burst...rest is good,Simple cloth iron, shortest=tv on off not working, so difficult to battery really a bad product, avg_length=1394)

	 NonnumericalMetadata(longest=Metal Gear is considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, it was also the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima, who also directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima's involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.
             

              The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.
             

              The player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the "Alert Mode." In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:
             

              If Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.
              
              However, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.
              
              The player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.
             

              The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.
             

              A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located., shortest=nan, avg_length=501)

	 NonnumericalMetadata(longest=["There's genuinely nothing funny I could say about Thracia, or anything that hasn't already been said about it that would do it justice. There's no other FE game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas, with Genealogy at least coming in close second. For every bullshit thing the game throws at you, the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter, and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error, actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell, I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. I think it's worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this.", 'amei as mecânicas do jogo espero que apareça em outros jogos ou algum futuro remake me diverti bem mais com esse comparado com o fe4\n                     \n                     envelheceu bem demais e algum dia vou revisitar mesmo com toda raiva que passei em alguns mapas', "I'm never touching this game for the rest of my life. I have never felt such hatred inside of me until I played this game. The story and characters really carry this game. Take me back to Genealogy please. Also, fuck the ballistae in this game.", "It's the kind of game that will kick in the stomach, laugh and continue to kick you, until it's get tired, but when it does, it will extend you a hand and treat you like a hero. Play it if you have some experience with tactical games otherwise you will have a bad time.", 'Oh my God. I can’t believe I slept on this game/ kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. Despite being on the SNES, it’s an absolute masterpiece of a game, which can be attributed to the fact it tests the SNES to its limits, being the final SNES game ever made, released in 1999, nine years after the SNES’s inception, and 3 years into the N64’s lifespan. Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well, but let’s focus on FE5.', 'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from "how the hell am i going to survive from this?" to "Hey, i can actually do this!" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\'s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\'t feel as powerless as before. And after you\'ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\'s significantly harder and risky to do,since you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. You\'ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\'s own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif, who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which is"representing the player"Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made. It\'s frusturating for sure, but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\'s impossible for me to hate it. I\'d highly recommend it if you liked FE4, and simply want to see more from this world.'], shortest=[], avg_length=1244)
